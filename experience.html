<center><p><font face="stencil"></font>This pandemic Covid-19 gives me a lot of experience including in adopt the new norma which is we need to wear a face mask when going outside and being at crowded places. We also need to always wear hand sanitizer and avoid touching with people to break the chain of Covid-19. Im so glad when online learning at home, my beloved family especially my parents always give support to me to stay motivated but no to forget to my friend especially my degree best girlfriend Siti Amirah & Shaza Shafikah that gives morale support and always helping me during lectures and when doing a task and assignment from lecturers. Lots of loves to my family and friends that always be my backbones. </center></p></font>
